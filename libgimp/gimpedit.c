/**
 * gimp_edit_paste_as_new:
 *
 * Paste buffer to a new image.
 *
 * This procedure pastes a copy of the internal GIMP edit buffer to a
 * new image. The GIMP edit buffer will be empty unless a call was
 * previously made to either gimp_edit_cut() or gimp_edit_copy(). This
 * procedure returns the new image or -1 if the edit buffer was empty.
 *
 * Deprecated: Use gimp_edit_paste_as_new_image() instead.
 *
 * Returns: The new image.
 *
 * Since: 2.4
