                   ------------------------------
                   GNU Image Manipulation Program
                          Development Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is the unstable development branch of GIMP. Here we are working
towards the next stable release, which will be GIMP 2.10.

Generally, all bug fixes that are applied on the stable GIMP 2.8
branch are also applied here, but they are usually not mentioned
in NEWS.

Overview of Changes from GIMP 2.9.4 to GIMP 2.9.6
=================================================

Core:

  - Layer modes' code is now refactored to separate gamma-corrected
    variations from the linear light ones, legacy modes have been
    preserved to support older XCF files.
  - New clipboard implementation allows copying/pasting layers and
    layer groups.
  - Color tags simplify managing large projects with a lot of layers
    and layer groups.
  - The Mouse Pointer dialog and colors applied to images are now
    color-managed.
  - Gamma and precision selectors for newly created images.
  - Never dither when converting to a higher bit depth, or to anything
    more than 16 bits; don't offer dithering options in these cases.
  - Default to linear when converting to 16-bit float.
  - Pre-initialize some babl-based pixel format conversion routines
    at start-up to decrease the initial lazy intialization cost for
    some interactions.

GUI:

  - Easily add or remove layer masks by clicking either the layer
    preview or a new button in the Layers dialog.
  - Enhance the Layer Attributes dialog to provide the single UI for
    setting layer's name, blending mode, opacity, and offset,
    toggling visibility, link status, various locks, color tags.
  - Add a Save As button to the “Quit GIMP” dialog and raise images
    on click for easy checks.
  - Allow to choose fill color when resizing layers and images.
  - Quick Mask and Channel Attributes dialogs use the new spinscale
    widget for the  mask opacity slider.
  - Enable grid views of dynamics and tool presets.
  - Allow to zoom with middle mouse button + control + drag up/down.
  - For all paint tools, when switching to the color picker mode,
    don't rely on the exact modifier being pressed or released. Instead,
    check if only the right modifier is pressed after *each* modifier
    change, and switch to color picking if it is.
  - On startup, GIMP checks for duplicate accelerators in menus, and
    removes duplicates.
  - Standard (Freedesktop) and GTK+ icons can now be set by the icon
    theme for a fully consistent style.
  - Many new icons.
  - Toolbox buttons do not grab focus anymore, which used to break
    usage of the Tab key and other canvas-related shortcuts after
    changing tools with a pointing device click.
  - Delete Layer/Channel/Path are consistently the last option in
    respective dialogs now.
  - Extend the text along the tangent of the last path stroke, when
    the length of the path is shorter than the width of the text to be
    warped.
  - Allow to toggle the histogram dialog between gamma and linear.
  - New 'Colors -> Linear Invert' command to provide radiometrically
    correct color inversion.

Configurability:

  - Remember settings of many dialogs across sessions.
  - New Interface / Dialog Defaults page in the Preferences dialog to
    control defaults values of various dialogs.
  - Settings on some individual pages of the Preferences dialog can be
    reset separately now.
  - Vertical scrollbar added to keep the height of the Preferences
    dialog fitting small displays.
  - Allow mouse to optionally configure tablet devices
  - Allow creating shortcuts containing the Cmd key + mouse wheel events.
  - Default to 300ppi and 1920x1080px for new documents.
  - Do not allow Alt+[0-9] shortcuts, they are typically reserved for
    display switching.

Tools:

  - The Move tool now shows relative coordinates when moving guides
    and sample points.
  - Performance of the Fuzzy Select and the Bucket Fill tool has been
    improved.
  - The Warp Transform tool now uses the linear sampler to ensure
    crisp lines after an erase.
  - Select by Color and Color Picker tools work now correctly in color
    spaces other than sRGB.
  - Color Picker doesn't snap to anything when picking colors anymore,
    always draws the outline of the averaged region (not only while the
    mouse is being pressed), and supports arbitrary range of values
    regardless of the actual image color precision.
  - Uncommitted selection by the Intelligent Scissors tool is not
    discarded on tool change anymore.
  - GIMP now checks whether the first and the last isegments are
    distinct before closing the curve.

Painting:

  - Rulers, scrollbars, and the Navigation dialog follow canvas
    rotation now.
  - Canvas rotation is now snappier in certain cases.
  - For bitmap brushes, GIMP now caches hardness and disables dynamic
    change of hardness to improve painting performance. Bitmap brushes
    also don't get clipped anymore, when hardness is less than 100.

File Formats

  - Add native WebP loader/exporter with support for ICC profiles,
    animation, metadata.
  - The TIFF loader will not generate warnings about private tags
    anymore.
  - Handle linear gamma PNG files correctly.
  - Load PSD files with layers which contain additional information
    with a length that is not divisible by 4.

Printing

  - Print resolution can now be reset to defaults, new values for the
    same image is actually used now without reloading the image.

Plug-ins

  - Port smooth-palette to GEGL.
  - Enhance the raw (not the digital negative) files plugin:
    introduce exporting settings and remember them across sessions,
    make the plugin invokable non-interactively, and more.

Color Palettes

  - Merge Palettes command is available for multiple selected color
    palettes now.

PDB:

  - Rename *-paste-as-new to *-paste-as-new-image.

Build:

  - Depends on LCMS2.7+ now, because earlier LCMS2 releases caused
    problems with certain GIMP blend modes.
  - Depends on libpng 1.6.25+ to avoid warnings about known incorrect
    sRGB profiles, also avoid various vulnerabilities.

OS-specific changes:

  - Help browser launches on macOS now.

Bugs:

  - Overall 79 bugs have been fixed or partially addressed since
    GIMP 2.9.4.

Translations:

  - Updated: Catalan, Czech, Danish, Finnish, French, German, Greek,
    Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Occitan, Polish, Portuguese, Russian,
    Scottish Gaelic, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish.
